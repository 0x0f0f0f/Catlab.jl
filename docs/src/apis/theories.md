# Standard library of theories

Through the module `Catlab.Theories`, Catlab provides a standard library of
[generalized algebraic theories](@ref gats) for categories, monoidal categories,
and other algebraic structures. The theories correspond, in most cases, to
standard definitions in category theory and they are used throughout Catlab and
the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem to structure programs and provide a common
interface for applied category theory. The module also provides default [syntax
sysytems](@ref syntax-systems) for many of the theories.
