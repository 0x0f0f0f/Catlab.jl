The top-level data structure is WiringDiagram, defined in the module Catlab.WiringDiagrams. A wiring diagram consists of boxes (usually of type Box) connected by wires (of type Wire). Each box has a sequence of input ports and a sequence of output ports, as does the wiring diagram itself. The wires have sources and targets, both of which consist of a box and a port on that box.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/wiring_diagrams/wiring_diagram_basics/","page":"Basics of wiring diagrams","title":"Basics of wiring diagrams","text":"The boxes in a wiring diagram are indexed by integer IDs.

For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as an object of study. In an algebraic theory, you have a collection of (total) operations and they obey a set of equational axioms. Classically, there is only a single generating type, but there are also typed or multi-sorted versions of algebraic theories. Most of the classical structures of abstract algebra, such as groups, rings, and modules, can be defined as algebraic theories.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Catlab.jl","title":"Catlab.jl","text":"Importantly, the theory of categories is not algebraic. In other words, a category cannot be defined as a (multi-sorted) algebraic theory.

In an essentially algebraic theory, you can have partially defined operations; however, to maintain the equational character of the system, the domains of operations must themselves be defined equationally. For example, the theory of category would be defined as having two types, Ob and Hom, and the composition operation compose(f::Hom,g::Hom)::Hom would have domain given by the equation codom(f) == dom(g). As your theories get more elaborate, the sets of equations defining the domains get more complicated and reasoning about the structure is overwhelming.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Catlab.jl","title":"Catlab.jl","text":"Later, Cartmell proposed generalized algebraic theories, which solves the same problem but in a different way. Rather than having partial operations, you have total operations but on dependent types (types that are parameterized by values). So now the composition operation has signature compose(f::Hom(A,B), g::Hom(B,C))::Hom(A,C) where (A::Ob, B::Ob, C::Ob)  exactly as appears in Catlab. This is closer to the way that mathematicians actually think and write about categories. For example, if you look at the definitions of category, functor, and natural transformation in Emily Riehl’s textbook, you will see that they are already essentially in the form of a GAT, whereas they require translation into an essentially algebraic theory. Nevertheless, GATs and essentially algebraic theories have the same expressive power, at least in their standard set-based semantics. GATs provide a version of the computer scientist's type theory that plays well with the mathematician's algebra, thus, providing a perfect opportunity for computer algebra systems.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Table-of-Contents","page":"Catlab.jl","title":"Table of Contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Catlab.jl","title":"Catlab.jl","text":"Pages = [\n     \"apis/core.md\",\n     \"apis/theories.md\",\n     \"apis/wiring_diagrams.md\",\n     \"apis/graphics.md\",\n     \"apis/programs.md\",\n     ]\nDepth = 2","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams/","page":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","title":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","text":"EditURL = \"https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl/blob/master/docs/literate/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams.jl\"","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams/#Drawing-wiring-diagrams-in-Compose.jl","page":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","title":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"generated/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams/","page":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","title":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams/","page":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","title":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","text":"Catlab can draw wiring diagrams using the Julia package Compose.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/graphics/composejl_wiring_diagrams/","page":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","title":"Drawing wiring diagrams in Compose.jl","text":"For best results, it is recommended to load the packages Convex.j and SCS.jl.
